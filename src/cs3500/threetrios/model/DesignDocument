Players:

Players are represented as an object that contains a color representing which player the object
is referring to. Players also contain a list of cards that represents their hand. This list is added
to when the model deals the cards, and it is removed from when the player plays a card to the board.

When constructing a model, a random, a card file, and a board file are passed to the constructor,
and the model will create two players, one blue and one red, and set them as fields. The model
will then use these two fields to distinguish player moves.
