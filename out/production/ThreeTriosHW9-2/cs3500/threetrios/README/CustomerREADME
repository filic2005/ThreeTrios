- created an IPlayerView interface that extends IThreeTriosViewGUI, and made PlayerView implement IPlayerView instead of
IThreeTriosViewGUI. This allows the controller to take in an interface with all the required functionality of PlayerView
instead of directly taking in PlayerView.

-Created Interfaces for Card and CardCell, then made the codebase impl and interfaces use those interfaces instead of
the concrete classes. We made IReadOnlyThreeTriosModel, IThreeTriosModel, ThreeTriosModel, and all our view classes and
interfaces use ICard and ICardCell instead of Card and CardCell.

These changes were needed because our codebase used concrete classes which weren't allowed to be shared, so we made it
use interfaces instead to make our code adaptable.
