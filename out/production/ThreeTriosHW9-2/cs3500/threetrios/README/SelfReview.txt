Our experience with our providers was great, they responded quickly and were able to address any questions or issues
we had with their code. As for our code design and implementation, it works well and runs pretty smoothly, but we also
had to refactor some of our code to use interfaces instead of concrete classes, and I wish we had thought of that
sooner, and other than that I think we did a pretty good job with both our design and implementation of the game.
